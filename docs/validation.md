# Foundation validation

Measured on macOS 26.4 (25E246), Apple M5 Max, on 2026-09-28. These are
independent numerical and behavioral acceptance checks. They do not establish
visual equivalence with Apple's native material styles.

## Independent rendering reference

The CPU reference integrates a continuous Gaussian using Simpson quadrature.
It shares no kernel weights, sampling strides, scale interpolation, or filtering
implementation with the Metal path. Captured pixels are constant unit cells;
convolution is sampled at destination pixel centers. The production filter uses
`libm::erf`, normalized four-sigma support, and paired linear texture sampling.

Coverage is checked against intersected pixel-cell area on straight edges.
Composition is checked analytically in linear RGB, including saturation, tint,
brightness, and ancestor opacity. Thresholds were fixed before the initial run
and were retained when the initial implementation failed.

| Worst observed metric | Initial implementation | Corrected implementation | Acceptance limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Gaussian energy error | 0.425% | 0.238% | 1.5% |
| Gaussian centroid drift | 0 px | 0 px | 0.05 px |
| Gaussian variance error | 21.894% | 0.694% | 5% |
| Normalized kernel L1 distance | 0.38404 | 0.01691 | 0.10 |
| Step maximum linear-light error | 0.08247 | 0.00435 | 0.015 |
| Fractional-edge error, encoded channel levels | 188 | 0 | 1 |
| Color/opacity error, encoded channel levels | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Variance is compared with the integrated reference's discrete second moment,
which includes the pixel-cell convention; it is not compared directly with
sigma squared. The matrix covers sigma 0.5/1/2/4/8 logical pixels, 1×/2×,
both axes, two odd extents, and three translated impulses. All 197 reported
metric lines matched across three independent runs. The exported six profiles
contained 1,542 rows and were byte-identical across those runs.

A separate refraction-coordinate oracle uses quantized linear-light ramps.
It checks four straight-edge normals, signed displacements, two optical widths,
and 1×/2× scaling. All 160 sampled coordinates agree within one encoded channel
level, below the preselected two-level limit. This verifies the coordinate
mapping, not whether its profile matches an undocumented Apple style.

The comparisons exposed and fixed:

- Small-radius and kernel-shape errors from blending Gaussian scale levels.
  Uniform blur now evaluates its requested kernel directly.
- Lost fractional-pixel coverage caused by rasterizing only the geometric
  rectangle. Raster and scene bounds now include the AA fringe while preserving
  output clipping and rejecting empty geometry.
- A spring clock bypass: the retained spring element used wall time instead of
  GPUI's scheduler clock, preventing deterministic frame progression in tests.

## Actual element and motion checks

The adapter tests execute GPUI layout, prepaint, and paint. They verify that
background precedes capture and content follows it, and exercise parent clipping
and opacity, all three outlines, both scales, and opaque/contrast fallbacks.
System preferences are injected into the cached application state for these
checks; the tests do not mutate macOS settings or claim to test delivery of a
real AppKit notification.

Retained GPUI spring tests use scheduler seeds 0, 1, and 42. They check position
continuity and forward momentum during reversal, stopping frame requests after
settling, mid-flight reduced-motion changes, and resuming with no stale velocity.
Common-time positions at 60/120 Hz, including a dropped frame, differ by less
than 0.05 logical pixels. The resumed trajectory agrees with a fresh spring
within 0.01 logical pixels.

## Performance sample

An optimized build rendered 20 measured frames after three warmups. Temporary
instrumentation read public Metal command-buffer GPU start/end timestamps after
completion; it was removed after collection. Times include every pass in that
command buffer, not just the glass fragment shader. Initialization took 21.862 ms
and may benefit from driver caches.

| Device size / sigma | Effects | GPU median / p95 | Submission + GPU + readback median / p95 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1024×768 / 6 px | 0 | 0.098 / 0.131 ms | 1.112 / 1.291 ms |
| 1024×768 / 6 px | 1 | 0.688 / 1.079 ms | 2.079 / 2.473 ms |
| 1024×768 / 6 px | 2 | 1.780 / 2.774 ms | 3.297 / 4.337 ms |
| 2048×1536 / 12 px | 0 | 0.228 / 0.942 ms | 4.490 / 5.374 ms |
| 2048×1536 / 12 px | 1 | 3.527 / 4.098 ms | 8.320 / 9.089 ms |
| 2048×1536 / 12 px | 2 | 6.043 / 8.291 ms | 12.777 / 23.440 ms |

This short sample is not a sustained frame-rate guarantee. Two Retina effects
already approach the 8.33 ms budget for 120 Hz before other UI and display work.
Full-window filtering remains the primary optimization target. Cropping or
sharing captures must preserve the current numerical and paint-order checks.

## Reproduction and native comparison

```sh
devenv test
devenv shell -- cargo test -p gpui-cupertino --test numeric_reference --locked -- --nocapture
devenv shell -- cargo bench -p gpui-cupertino --bench backdrop --locked
```

Set `CUPERTINO_REFERENCE_OUTPUT` to an absolute CSV filename with an existing
parent directory to export the measured Gaussian curves from the numerical
check. The benchmark prints synchronous render/readback timing; the isolated
GPU measurements above used the temporary diagnostic instrumentation described
above.

On macOS 26 or later, with an **unlocked, visible desktop session** and screen
recording permission:

```sh
devenv shell -- cargo run -p gpui-cupertino --example native_compare --locked -- work/comparison
```

This creates an owned AppKit window: public `NSGlassEffectView` on the left,
Metal readback using demo calibration parameters on the right. Both receive the
same background and logical geometry. It captures light/dark, regular/clear,
two background phases, and two repeated snapshots of each case. The screenshot
metadata printed by the example includes actual display scale and key-window
state. The calibration parameters are illustrative and have not been fitted to
Apple's opaque style definitions.

Native capture was attempted but blocked by the host's locked graphical session;
screen recording permission was present. No successful Apple comparison image
or native visual-equivalence result is claimed. Numerical CSV exports remain
available independently of the graphical session.
